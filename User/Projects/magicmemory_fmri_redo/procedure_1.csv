0,instruct,user,"<p> Dear participant </p><p> Thank you very much for accepting the invitation to participate in the second part of the MAGMOT study. </p><p> During this part, you will be asked to try to remember the magic tricks you have seen inside the MRI scanner a week ago. <br> This includes a cued recall where we will present you still images of each of the 36 magic tricks and ask you to briefly describe what has happened in the magic trick. Depending on your answers in the recall tests, we will categories each magic trick you have seen in the first experiment as either remembered or forgotten. To enable us to do that, please try to be as distinct, specific and descriptive as possible when referring to the magic tricks. <br> Further, there will be a recognition test where you will see the same 36 still images and offered four choices to answer the question, ""what happens in this magic trick?"". You are asked to pick the correct answer and to indicate afterwards how confident you feel regarding your answer.</p><p> We estimate the duration of the task to be 45 min. You will receive additional course credit/monetary reward for your participation in this part of the study. </p>",off,Welcome,,
0,instruct,user,"<p> In the following trials, we will present you still images of the 36 magic tricks you have seen in random order. Please write down what has happened in the trick cued by the picture.  </p><p> Again, please try to write down your answer as descriptive as possible, so that we are able to judge whether you recalled a specific magic trick or not.</p> If you cannot recall what has happened in the magic trick cued by the still image, please insert ""no recall"".",off,instruction,,

0,instruct,user,"<p> Thank you for completing the cued recall task. </p> Next, there will be a recognition memory test. You will see the same images as before in random order and again, you are asked to correctly recall what has happened in the magic trick. This time, however, you will be offered with four answers and we would kindly ask you to pick the correct one. Afterwards, please indicate how confident you are regarding your answer. That means if you are certain that this is the correct answer, your confidence will be high whereas it is low in case you are guessing.",off,,,

0,debrief_magmot,user,"<p> Dear participant, </p><p> Thank you for completing the task. </p><p> The purpose of this study was to find out how curiosity and the availability of reward can influence memory performances. We hypothesise that both, reward and high levels of curiosity will have enhancing effects and lead to the magic tricks being better encoded. We further investigate the neural underpinnings of this phenomena which we expect to be mirrored in the reward network, medial temporal lobe and mid brain.</p><p> We manipulated the availability of reward in the following ways: Some participants were not offered any reward for finding the correct estimate on how many people are able to find the solution, while other participants were offered an additional Â£0.80 for each correct estimate on how many people are able to find the solution to the magic trick.</p><p> We offered money to some of the participants to be able to look at the effect of the availability of monetary reward on memory. We asked you to rate your curiosity to determine how curiosity influences memory performances. We asked you to provide an estimate on how many people will be able to solve the magic trick to make sure that you are engaged in the task and pay attention to it. However, we never collected data on how many people are able to find the solution Ã¢ÂÂ therefore, there are no right or wrong answers to this question, and this was our cover story. We would like to apologise for any inconveniences caused by this. Out of curtesy, we pay the same bonus to all participants. </p><p> We would like to thank you again for participating in this experiment and supporting our research. If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. </p><p> Kind regards, </p><p> Stef Meliss (email: stefanie.meliss@pgr.reading.ac.uk) and Kou Murayama (email: k.murayama@reading.ac.uk) </p>",off,debrief,,
